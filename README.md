# Creating a Product Landing Page
This project focuses on creating an actual page that is visually appealing and common across the internet.

# My Goals With This Project
1. Build up my Portfolio
2. Gain more knowledge around the look and feel of a web page
3. Get more work on the things previously covered like Flexbox and the the Box Model.
